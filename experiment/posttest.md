<br>

Q2. If 50 mL of HCl is required in the blank titration and 40 mL is required in the sample titration, what is the implication?<br>

a. 50 mL of HCl was consumed in the saponification process  <br>
b. 10 mL of KOH was consumed in the saponification process  <br>
c. 40 mL of KOH was consumed in the saponification process  <br>

b. Using a longer chain fatty acid  <br>
c. Using a shorter chain fatty acid  <br>
d. Using a stronger acid for titration <br> 
<br>

Q5. Why is it important to use an excess of KOH in the saponification process?<br>

a. To ensure complete hydrolysis of the fat/oil  <br>
b. To neutralize the fatty acids  <br>
c. To prevent the formation of glycerol  <br>
